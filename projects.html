      <p class="subhead">Check Splitter (IP)</p>
      <p>This is my first app idea that is currently in progress. It is a simple app idea of splitting the check among a group
         that removes the hassle of calculating how much each person has to pay depending on how much they have, how much their meal costs, or
         whether they need to borrow money. It will also include the feature that keeps track of who owes whom how much money from previous calculations.</p>
      <p class="subhead"><a href="https://bugsrus.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Pest Control Counter (OpenCV/Python)</a></p>
      <p>This web app was created to replace the laborious task of manually counting hundreds of tiny insects in the Oxford Greenhouse at UC Berkeley.
        Because the flytraps used had dark and notable grids, we decided the best strategy was to use blob detection and line detection to segment the trap into 
        cropped sections and apply the algorithm individually. The program then outputs a list of cropped out images that the algorithm detected as bugs. 
        In the future, we hope to add the functionality of allowing the user to verify whether each cropped image was indeed a bug or not so that we can train our 
        model to improve overtime, adding a machine learning aspect and extra layer of accuracy onto our model.

      <p class="subhead"><a href="https://github.com/JennessaMa/SpotifyPredictor/blob/main/MusicFinalProject.py" target="_blank">Spotify Predictor (Python)</a></p>
      <p>This mini-project uses the Spotipy framework to predict which songs given in the annual Spotify Wrapped's "Missed Hits"
        playlist the user will actually enjoy. Using cosine similarity as a method of assigning value, I chose a threshold value and 
        extracted the data features (valence, danceability, loudness, tempo, etc) from each song object and applied math formulas to 
        determine how this song would performed compared to the threshold value.

      <p class="subhead"><a href="https://jennessama.github.io/" target="_blank">Quarantine Website (HTML/CSS/Javascript)</a></p>
      <p>A simple website that includes ideas on what to do when you're bored in quarantine. It includes simple animations
         created with css in addition to a dark mode feature implemented with javascript. I was able to research ideas on
         getting the dark mode feature to persist throughout the different pages as they each included a different script and
         this was achieved by using the window.localStorage element.</p>
      <p>This project allowed me to get creative with how I try to implement different features as there are a multitude of solutions
         on the internet available while researching. I was amazed by the many unique solutions people offered and learned a lot by simply
         trying to solve one problem.</p>
      <p class="subhead">*NUMC (C/Python)</p>
      <p>This project is from the CS61C Machine Structures class. It is designed to challenge both my C skills and ability to 
        improve the performance of matrix operations. With a Python-C interface, I replicated the NumPy functions of matrix addition, multiplication,
        subtraction, power, absolute value, and negation. Using optimization methods of SIMD, OpenMP, loop unrollling, cache manipulation, matrix transposition,
        and carefully chosen mathematical techniques, I achieved 120x speedup for matrix multiplication, 1700x speedup matrix exponentiation, and 5x speedup for 
        other basic matrix operations compared to the naively implemented solutions.
      </p>
      <p class="subhead">*Gitlet (Java)</p>
      <p>This project is from the CS61B Data Structures class. I implemented a version-control
        system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git. The main functionalities
        implemented are: saving the contents of entire directories of files (commit), restoring a version
        of one or more files or entire commits (checkout), viewing the history of your backups (log), maintaining
        related sequences of commits (branch), and merging changes made in one branch into another.</p>
      <p>This was the the first project I implemented that required us to create our own skeleton and structure of
         our code. I enjoyed this project very much as it was challening and allowed me to fully understand the complex
         actions of Git. I was also able to integrate ideas of serialization, functional programming, and efficient
         runtime with certain data structures together in Gitlet. </p>
      <p>*Due to academic honesty policies, this project is not publicly available on my github.</p>
      <p class="subhead">*Lines of Action (Java)</p>
      <p>This project is frmo the CS61B Data Structures class. Using the board game Lines of Action created by Claude Soucie, I implemented
         its rules, winning conditions, and legal moves. I also created an AI to play the game against the staff AI by strategizing which
         moves were most optimal in early, middle, and endgame to satisfy the win conditions. In order to choose moves without
         having extreme runtimes, I made use of alpha-beta pruning with a carefully constructed heuristic function in order to efficiently
         play the game. This also required me to choose specific data structures and construct algorithms that did not prolong the calculations
         of each move and state of the board. </p>

      <p class="subhead"><a href="https://github.com/JennessaMa/CS61A/tree/master/projects/cats" target="_blank">Type Racer (Python)</a></p>
      <p>This project is from the CS61A Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs class. I created a program
        that measures typing speed with autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of
        a word after a user types it. Similar to other type racer programs, this will return the percentage of words
        typed correctly, words per minute, and a report progress that shows the time used per word. This project also
        allows for multiplayer functionality which will output more information comparing how well each player did, such
        as the fastest words typed.</p>
      <p>My favorite parts project allowed me to explore the algorithm needed to implement the autocorrect function.
         It required a swapping method that returns the minimum number of characters needed to changed from
         the start start string to the goal string. Additionally, autocrrect required the fixing method that minimizes
         the number of edits needed to transform the start word to the goal word.</p>
