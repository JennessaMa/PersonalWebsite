      <p class="subhead">Check Splitter (IP)</p>
      <p>This is my first app idea that is currently in progress. It is a simple app idea of splitting the check among a group
         that removes the hassle of calculating how much each person has to pay depending on how much they have, how much their meal costs, or
         whether they need to borrow money. It will also include the feature that keeps track of who owes whom how much money from previous calculations.</p>
      <p class="subhead">*Gitlet (Java)</p>
      <p>This project is from the CS61B Data Structures class. I implemented a version-control
        system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git. The main functionalities
        implemented are: saving the contents of entire directories of files (commit), restoring a version
        of one or more files or entire commits (checkout), viewing the history of your backups (log), maintaining
        related sequences of commits (branch), and merging changes made in one branch into another.</p>
      <p>This was the the first project I implemented that required us to create our own skeleton and structure of
         our code. I enjoyed this project very much as it was challening and allowed me to fully understand the complex
         actions of Git. I was also able to integrate ideas of serialization, functional programming, and efficient
         runtime with certain data structures together in Gitlet. </p>
      <p>*Due to academic honesty policies, this project is not publicly available on my github.</p>
      <p class="subhead">*Lines of Action (Java)</p>
      <p>This project is frmo the CS61B Data Structures class. Using the board game Lines of Action created by Claude Soucie, I implemented
         its rules, winning conditions, and legal moves. I also created an AI to play the game against the staff AI by strategizing which
         moves were most optimal in early, middle, and endgame to satisfy the win conditions. In order to choose moves without
         having extreme runtimes, I made use of alpha-beta pruning with a carefully constructed heuristic function in order to efficiently
         play the game. This also required me to choose specific data structures and construct algorithms that did not prolong the calculations
         of each move and state of the board. </p>
      <p>*Due to academic honesty policies, this project is not publicly available on my github.</p>
      <p class="subhead"><a href="https://github.com/JennessaMa/CS61A/tree/master/projects/cats" target="_blank">Type Racer (Python)</a></p>
      <p>This project is from the CS61A Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs class. I created a program
        that measures typing speed with autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of
        a word after a user types it. Similar to other type racer programs, this will return the percentage of words
        typed correctly, words per minute, and a report progress that shows the time used per word. This project also
        allows for multiplayer functionality which will output more information comparing how well each player did, such
        as the fastest words typed.</p>
      <p>My favorite parts project allowed me to explore the algorithm needed to implement the autocorrect function.
         It required a swapping method that returns the minimum number of characters needed to changed from
         the start start string to the goal string. Additionally, autocrrect required the fixing method that minimizes
         the number of edits needed to transform the start word to the goal word.</p>
      <p class="subhead"><a href="https://jennessama.github.io/" target="_blank">Quarantine Website (HTML/CSS/Javascript)</a></p>
      <p>A simple website that includes ideas on what to do when you're bored in quarantine. It includes simple animations
         created with css in addition to a dark mode feature implemented with javascript. I was able to research ideas on
         getting the dark mode feature to persist throughout the different pages as they each included a different script and
         this was achieved by using the window.localStorage element.</p>
      <p>This project allowed me to get creative with how I try to implement different features as there are a multitude of solutions
         on the internet available while researching. I was amazed by the many unique solutions people offered and learned a lot by simply
         trying to solve one problem.</p>
