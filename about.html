        <p>Hello! My name is Jennessa Ma and I am a third year student at UC Berkeley majoring in computer science.</p>
        <p>I am passionate for technology and always excited to learn, grow, innovate, and create. Starting from high school
           robotics to university level software engineering projects, I enjoy challenging myself to new and exciting opportunities
           that enable me with the skills needed to create more efficient and creative products. I am always ecstatic to take on learning
           experiences through clubs and organizations while pushing myself to expand my skillset. </p>
        <p>I am currently participating in a react native training program to become more versatile in terms of app development 
          through the Mobile Developers of Berkeley organization. </p>
