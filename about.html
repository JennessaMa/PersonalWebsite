        <p>Hello! My name is Jennessa Ma and I am an incoming second year student at UC Berkeley studying computer science.</p>
        <p>I am passionate for technology and always excited to learn, grow, innovate, and create. Starting from high school
           robotics to university level software engineering projects, I enjoy challenging myself to new and exciting opportunities
           that enable me with the skills needed to create more efficient and creative products. I am always ecstatic to take on learning
           experiences through clubs and organizations while pushing myself to expand my skillset. </p>
        <p>I am currently attempting to create my very first app: Check Splitter. With my current knowledge of multiple programming languages,
           as well as some front end and design princples, I hope to successfully learn Swift and create my first simple app within this year.</p>
